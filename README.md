Flashysms is a web based application for sending sms and also storing contacts and contacts information.
It's built using **Django framework** for backend,**html,css and javascript** for frontend and **africastalking** API for sending sms.

Being a web base app make it easier for the user to send sms as long as they have access to internet,browser and login credential to login to the website and also the user can send mass sms at once.
This app is useful in an organisation if they have multiple customer service care agents because both agents can use the system at the same time but with different credential each.
